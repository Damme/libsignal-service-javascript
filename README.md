# libsignal-service-javascript
**This is a third-party effort, and is NOT a part of the official [Signal](https://signal.org) project or any other project of [Open Whisper Systems](https://whispersystems.org).**

A javascript library for basic interaction with the [Signal](https://signal.org) messaging service. This library is a standalone port to [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) of the backend components of [Signal-Desktop](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Desktop). Not to be confused with [libsignal-protocol-javascript](https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal-protocol-javascript), which only includes the Signal wire protocol, this library contains the logic for actually interacting with the Signal messaging servers as currently operated by OWS. As such, it is intended to be a Javascript equivalent of [libsignal-service-java](https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal-service-java) and provide a similar API.
